# ReadWriteBurn Integration Analysis Overview
Date: July 10, 2025

## Purpose
This document analyzes the current state of integration between the client, server, and chaincode components of the ReadWriteBurn application. The goal is to identify gaps, mismatches, and required implementations to ensure proper data flow from client → server → chaincode.

## Analysis Scope
1. Client API endpoint usage and expectations
2. Server route definitions and implementations
3. Chaincode method signatures and requirements
4. Data flow and transformation requirements
5. Authentication and signing integration
6. Hard-coded test data that needs to be replaced

## Key Areas of Focus
- Fire creation flow (FireStarter)
- Submission creation flow (ContributeSubmission)
- Voting flow (CastVote)
- Identity/wallet management
- Fee handling and authorization
- Content verification and hashing

## Methodology
1. Trace each client API call to its server endpoint
2. Verify server endpoint implementations
3. Check if server calls appropriate chaincode methods
4. Identify data transformation requirements
5. Document missing implementations
6. Note hard-coded or mock data
