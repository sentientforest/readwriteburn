# Data Model Updates: Server & Client Alignment

**Date**: July 31, 2025
**Scope**: Align server and client applications with updated chaincode data models
**Focus**: Three-tier DTO alignment (Client ↔ Server ↔ Chaincode) with proper fee handling

## Executive Summary

Following significant chaincode data model changes, we need to update the server and client applications to maintain compatibility.
The key changes involve enhanced response DTOs that provide chain keys directly, proper three-tier data flow alignment,
and compound DTO structures for fee authorization/verification flows between client, server, and chaincode.

## Chaincode Changes Summary (Completed)

### Key Model Changes
1. **Enhanced Response DTOs** - `FireResDto` and `ContributeSubmissionResDto` now provide chain keys directly
2. **Submissions auto-parent to Fire** - When `entryParentKey` is undefined, automatically set to Fire
3. **Chain key identifiers in responses** - Eliminate need for client-side key generation
4. **Enhanced fetch logic** - Submissions can be fetched with nested sub-comments included
5. **Compound DTO structures** - Fee verification integrated into submission/fire creation DTOs

### Current Status
- ✅ **Chaincode**: Updated and all tests passing
- ❌ **Server**: DTO misalignment and missing chain key handling
- ❌ **Client**: Outdated API types and missing compound DTO support

## Server Updates Required

### 1. DTO Import and Response Handling (High Priority)

**Issue**: Server lacks chaincode DTO imports and enhanced response handling
**Impact**: Cannot process enhanced response structures or provide chain keys to clients

**Root Cause**: Server needs to import and use chaincode DTOs directly:
- `FireResDto` (includes `fireKey` field)
- `ContributeSubmissionResDto` (includes `submissionKey` field)
- Enhanced compound DTOs with fee verification

**Files to Update**:
- `server/src/types.ts` - Import chaincode DTOs directly
- `server/src/controllers/fires.ts` - Handle `FireResDto` responses with `fireKey`
- `server/src/controllers/submissions.ts` - Handle `ContributeSubmissionResDto` responses with `submissionKey`

**Changes Required**:
```typescript
// Import chaincode DTOs directly in server/src/types.ts
import {
  FireResDto,
  ContributeSubmissionResDto,
  FireStarterDto,
  ContributeSubmissionDto,
  FireStarterAuthorizationDto,
  ContributeSubmissionAuthorizationDto
} from '../chaincode/src/readwriteburn';

// Update fire controller to handle enhanced response
const chainResponse = await submitToChaincode('FireStarter', dto);
const fireResult = chainResponse.data as FireResDto;
// fireResult.fireKey contains the chain composite key
// fireResult.metadata contains the Fire object

// Update submission controller to handle enhanced response
const chainResponse = await submitToChaincode('ContributeSubmission', dto);
const submissionResult = chainResponse.data as ContributeSubmissionResDto;
// submissionResult.submissionKey contains the chain composite key
// submissionResult.submission contains the Submission object
```

**Critical Fix**: Server imports chaincode DTOs directly. Chaincode provides chain keys in response - server no longer generates them.

### 2. Three-Tier DTO Flow Implementation (High Priority)

**Issue**: Complex fee authorization flow requires different DTO handling at each tier
**Impact**: Fee transactions fail due to incorrect DTO transformation between tiers

**Three-Tier Data Flow**:
1. **Client → Server**: Fee Authorization DTOs (client-signed)
2. **Server → Asset Channel**: Fee verification and authorization
3. **Server → Chaincode**: Fee verification + original request (server-signed)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Client creates `FireStarterAuthorizationDto` with client-signed fee authorization
- Server must verify fee on assets channel, then send `FireStarterDto` with fee verification to chaincode
- Similar pattern for `ContributeSubmissionAuthorizationDto` → `ContributeSubmissionDto`

**Files to Update**:
- `server/src/types.ts` - Import authorization and submission DTOs from chaincode
- `server/src/controllers/fires.ts` - Handle `FireStarterAuthorizationDto` → `FireStarterDto` transformation
- `server/src/controllers/submissions.ts` - Handle `ContributeSubmissionAuthorizationDto` → `ContributeSubmissionDto` transformation

**Server Changes Required**:
```typescript
// Current implementation in fires.ts (lines 103-146) needs updates:
export async function fireStarter(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // 1. Parse client authorization DTO (already implemented)
  const authDto: FireStarterAuthorizationDto = deserialize(FireStarterAuthorizationDto, req.body);
  const { fire, fee } = authDto;

  // 2. Verify fee on assets channel (currently disabled but structure exists)
  // should submit to `FeeAuthorizationDto` to `AuthorizeFee` method on GalaChainTokenContract on assets channel
  const feeVerification = await authorizeFee(fee);

  // 3. Create server-signed submission DTO (already implemented)
  const serverDto = await createValidDTO(FireStarterDto, {
    fire: fire,
    fee: feeVerification, // Add fee verification
    uniqueKey: `readwriteburn-${randomUniqueKey()}`
  }).signed(getAdminPrivateKey());

  // 4. Submit to chaincode and handle FireResDto response
  const chainResponse = await submitToChaincode('FireStarter', serverDto);
  const fireResult = chainResponse.data as FireResDto;

  // 5. Extract chain key and metadata for database storage
  const chainKey = fireResult.fireKey;
  const fireMetadata = fireResult.metadata;
}
```

**Critical Fix**: Use proper compound DTO flow - do NOT bypass fee verification.

### 3. Nested Submission API Endpoints (Medium Priority)

**Issue**: No API support for fetching nested submissions
**Impact**: Client needs this to display threaded discussions efficiently

**New Endpoints Required**:
```typescript
GET /api/submissions/:chainKey/replies  // Fetch child submissions
GET /api/fires/:slug/submissions?depth=1    // Top-level only
GET /api/fires/:slug/submissions?depth=all  // Include nested
```

### 4. Database Chain Key Storage and Response Parsing (High Priority)

**Issue**: Database layer needs significant updates to handle new chaincode response structures
**Impact**: Server cannot properly store or retrieve chain keys and metadata from enhanced responses

**Critical Problems Identified**:

1. **Fire Controller Response Parsing** (lines 158-172):
   ```typescript
   // Current - incorrect approach
   const fireResult = chainResponse.data as any; // FireResDto
   const fireMetadata = fireResult.metadata || fireResult;
   const created = dbService.createSubfire(fireMetadata);
   
   // Should be - proper FireResDto handling
   const fireResult = chainResponse.data as FireResDto;
   const chainKey = fireResult.fireKey;           // Use provided chain key
   const fireMetadata = fireResult.metadata;     // Extract Fire object
   ```

2. **Submission Controller Response Parsing** (lines 71-74):
   ```typescript
   // Current - incorrect approach
   const submissionResult = chainResponse.data as any; // Submission object
   const created = dbService.saveSubmission(submissionResult);
   
   // Should be - proper ContributeSubmissionResDto handling
   const submissionResult = chainResponse.data as ContributeSubmissionResDto;
   const chainKey = submissionResult.submissionKey;     // Use provided chain key
   const submission = submissionResult.submission;      // Extract Submission object
   ```

3. **Database Storage Methods Need Chain Key Parameters**:
   - `dbService.createSubfire()` expects `getCompositeKey()` method but should accept direct `fireKey`
   - `dbService.saveSubmission()` expects single object but should accept `submissionKey` + `submission`

**Files Requiring Updates**:

**server/src/controllers/fires.ts** (lines 158-172):
```typescript
// Update fire creation response handling
const fireResult = chainResponse.data as FireResDto;
const created = dbService.createSubfire(fireResult.metadata, fireResult.fireKey);
```

**server/src/controllers/submissions.ts** (lines 71-74):
```typescript  
// Update submission creation response handling
const submissionResult = chainResponse.data as ContributeSubmissionResDto;
const created = dbService.saveSubmission(
  submissionResult.submission, 
  submissionResult.submissionKey
);
```

**server/src/db.ts** (lines 91-141):
```typescript
// Update createSubfire signature
createSubfire: (fireMetadata: Fire, chainKey: string): FireDto => {
  // Use provided chainKey instead of calling getCompositeKey()
  const insertSubfire = getDb().prepare(`
    INSERT OR REPLACE INTO subfires (slug, name, description, chain_key)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
  `);
  insertSubfire.run(slug, name, description, chainKey); // Direct usage
}
```

**server/src/db.ts** (lines 248-384):
```typescript
// Update saveSubmission signature  
saveSubmission: (submission: Submission, chainKey: string): SubmissionResDto => {
  // Use provided chainKey instead of calling getCompositeKey()
  const insertSubmission = getDb().prepare(`
    INSERT OR REPLACE INTO submissions (..., chain_key, ...)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
  `);
  insertSubmission.run(..., chainKey, ...); // Direct usage
}
```

**Database Schema Status**: ✅ Already supports chain keys (migrations v2-v4)
**Migration Requirements**: None - schema is ready
**Priority**: High - current parsing approach will fail with new response structures

### 5. Vote Processing Updates (Low Priority - Future Phase)

**Issue**: Vote controller assumes `entryParent` is always Fire
**Impact**: Votes on nested submissions may not process correctly

**Note**: Deferred to voting phase as per requirements

## Client Updates Required

### 1. Chain Key Response Handling (High Priority)

**Issue**: Client API types don't include chain keys from enhanced server responses
**Impact**: Client cannot access composite keys needed for voting and threading

**Files to Update**:
- `client/src/types/api.ts` - Add `chainKey` fields to response interfaces
- `stores/fires.ts` - Use server-provided chain keys
- `stores/submissions.ts` - Use server-provided chain keys

**Changes Required**:
```typescript
// Update client/src/types/api.ts (lines 12-21, 35-50)
interface FireResponse {
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  created_at: string;
  starter: string;
  authorities: string[];
  moderators: string[];
  entryParent?: string;
  chainKey: string;  // NEW: Chain composite key from server
}

interface SubmissionResponse {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  url?: string;
  contributor: string;
  subfire_id: string;
  content_hash: string;
  hash_verified: boolean;
  moderation_status: "active" | "flagged" | "removed" | "modified";
  content_timestamp: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at?: string;
  votes?: number;
  entryParent?: string;
  chainKey: string;  // NEW: Chain composite key from server
}
```

### 2. Compound DTO Handling (High Priority)

**Issue**: Client needs to create authorization DTOs with proper fee structure
**Impact**: Fee authorization flow fails without proper compound DTO structure

**Files to Update**:
- `components/FireStarter.vue` - Create `FireStarterAuthorizationDto`
- `components/NewSubmission.vue` - Create `ContributeSubmissionAuthorizationDto`
- Client voting components - Create `CastVoteAuthorizationDto`

**Changes Required**:
```typescript
// Client must create authorization DTOs, not submission DTOs directly
// FireStarter.vue
const authDto = new FireStarterAuthorizationDto({
  fire: new FireDto({
    slug: fireSlug,
    name: fireName,
    starter: userRef,
    // ... other fields
  }).signed(userPrivateKey),
  fee: new FeeAuthorizationDto({
    // client-signed fee authorization
  }).signed(userPrivateKey)
});

// Submit authorization DTO to server
const response = await api.post('/fires', authDto);
// Server returns enhanced response with chainKey
const fireResult: FireResponse = response.data;
const chainKey = fireResult.chainKey;
```

### 3. Voting Chain Key Usage (Medium Priority)

**Issue**: Components must use server-provided chain keys for voting, not client-constructed keys
**Impact**: Vote transactions fail with invalid entry references

**Files to Update**:
- `SubmissionList.vue` (voting logic)
- `ThreadedSubmission.vue` (voting logic)
- Voting components

**Changes Required**:
```typescript
// Use server-provided chain keys in vote DTOs
const voteDto = new CastVoteAuthorizationDto({
  vote: new VoteDto({
    entry: submission.chainKey,     // From server response
    entryParent: fire.chainKey,    // From server response
    entryType: "RWBS",            // Submission type
    quantity: burnAmount,
    // ... other fields
  }).signed(userPrivateKey),
  fee: feeAuthorizationDto  // Client-signed fee
});
```

### 4. Nested Submission Display (Medium Priority)

**Issue**: Components may not properly handle the new nested submission API responses
**Impact**: Threading and reply functionality broken

**Files to Update**:
- `SubmissionList.vue` (nested display logic)
- `ThreadedSubmission.vue` (child submission handling)

## REVISED Implementation Plan

**⚠️ CRITICAL PM ASSESSMENT: The original plan had dependency violations and missing critical path analysis. This revision prioritizes correctness and smooth development flow.**

### Pre-Phase: Investigation & Risk Mitigation (Days 1-2)
**Owner**: Senior Backend Engineer + PM
**Blockers**: Must complete before any development begins

**Critical Unknowns to Resolve**:
1. **Fee Verification Timeline**: Current fires.ts has fee verification disabled (lines 120-127)
   - **Decision Required**: Re-enable now or defer to separate sprint?
   - **Impact**: If deferred, entire fee authorization flow can be stubbed
   - **Risk**: Changes to fee flow could require rework of DTO implementation

2. **Backwards Compatibility Requirements**: 
   - **Question**: Are there existing client instances that cannot be updated simultaneously?
   - **Impact**: Determines if we need API versioning or can do breaking changes
   - **Risk**: Could double development effort if compatibility layers needed

3. **Database Migration Strategy**:
   - **Question**: Can we do schema changes in production or need zero-downtime approach?
   - **Decision Required**: Database deployment strategy
   - **Risk**: Could block entire server rollout

**Investigation Tasks**:
- [ ] Test current fee authorization flow end-to-end
- [ ] Inventory existing client deployments and update capabilities
- [ ] Validate database migration approach in staging environment
- [ ] Confirm chaincode response format hasn't changed since tests were updated

- **1 Frontend Engineer**: Client integration work (Phases 2-3)  
- **1 QA Engineer**: Testing throughout all phases
- **1 PM**: Coordination, risk management, blockers resolution

**Skills Critical**:
- GalaChain/Hyperledger Fabric experience (backend engineer)
- Vue.js + TypeScript experience (frontend engineer)
- Database migration experience (backend engineer or DBA)

## Risk Management & Contingencies

### High-Risk Items with Mitigation

1. **Fee Verification Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Fee authorization flow more complex than anticipated
   - **Mitigation**: Stub fee verification if investigation shows complexity
   - **Trigger**: If Pre-Phase investigation takes >2 days

2. **Database Migration Issues**
   - **Risk**: Production migration fails or causes downtime
   - **Mitigation**: Practice migrations in staging, have rollback scripts ready
   - **Trigger**: Any migration failure in staging

3. **Client Breaking Changes**
   - **Risk**: Existing clients break when server updates deploy
   - **Mitigation**: API versioning if backwards compatibility required
   - **Trigger**: Pre-Phase investigation reveals existing client dependencies

### Rollback Strategy

**Phase 1 Rollback**: Revert database service changes, restore original controller logic
**Phase 2 Rollback**: Client can continue using original server APIs
**Phase 3 Rollback**: Disable new nested API endpoints, revert to flat submission display

## Decision Points Requiring PM/Tech Lead Approval

1. **Day 2**: Fee verification approach (enable now vs defer)
2. **Day 7**: Go/No-Go for Phase 2 (server functionality must be validated)
3. **Day 12**: Go/No-Go for Phase 3 (basic client integration must work)
4. **Day 17**: Go/No-Go for production deployment preparation

## Project Constraints & Critical Assumptions

### Assumptions That Could Invalidate Plan

**⚠️ THESE ASSUMPTIONS MUST BE VALIDATED DURING PRE-PHASE**

1. **Chaincode Stability Assumption**
   - **Assumption**: Chaincode data models and response structures won't change during implementation
   - **Risk**: If chaincode changes, could require complete rework
   - **Validation Required**: Confirm chaincode development is frozen for this sprint

2. **Database Migration Assumption**
   - **Assumption**: Current database already has all required `chain_key` columns via migrations
   - **Risk**: Production database may be out of sync with migration scripts
   - **Validation Required**: Audit production database schema before any deployment

3. **Client Deployment Assumption**
   - **Assumption**: All client instances can be updated simultaneously with server
   - **Risk**: If gradual rollout required, need API versioning
   - **Validation Required**: Confirm client deployment strategy

4. **Fee Verification Scope Assumption**
   - **Assumption**: Fee verification can remain disabled or be easily re-enabled
   - **Risk**: Re-enabling fees could require significant DTO flow changes
   - **Validation Required**: Test fee verification flow end-to-end

### Technical Constraints

1. **GalaChain Integration Constraint**
   - **Limitation**: Server must maintain exact DTO compatibility with chaincode
   - **Impact**: Cannot modify DTO structures without chaincode coordination
   - **Mitigation**: Import chaincode DTOs directly to maintain type safety

2. **Database Schema Constraint**
   - **Limitation**: SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN operations safely
   - **Impact**: Old columns remain in database, migrations are append-only
   - **Mitigation**: Plan assumes existing migrations are correct

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode Constraint**
   - **Limitation**: All components use strict TypeScript compilation
   - **Impact**: Any type mismatches will cause build failures
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental testing at each phase

### Questions Requiring Senior Technical Decision

**Cannot proceed with confidence until these are answered:**

1. **Fee Authorization Architecture**
   - **Question**: Is the three-tier fee flow (Client → Server → Assets Channel → Chaincode) correct?
   - **Current State**: Implementation exists but is disabled
   - **Decision Needed**: Architecture validation before implementing client compound DTOs

2. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - **Question**: How should server handle chaincode validation errors in new response format?
   - **Current State**: Error handling assumes simple response objects
   - **Decision Needed**: Error parsing strategy for compound response DTOs

3. **API Versioning Strategy**
   - **Question**: Do we need to maintain backwards compatibility with existing API clients?
   - **Current State**: Unknown if breaking changes are acceptable
   - **Decision Needed**: API versioning approach (v1/v2 endpoints vs breaking changes)

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - **Question**: What are the performance requirements for nested submission fetching?
   - **Current State**: No defined performance criteria
   - **Decision Needed**: Query optimization strategy for deep threading

### Scope Limitations

**Items explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this implementation:**

1. **Vote Processing Updates**: Deferred to separate voting phase sprint
2. **Fire Hierarchy**: Flattened architecture, no nested fire support
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/SSE implementation deferred
4. **Advanced UI Features**: Search, filtering, pagination deferred to future sprints

### Success Metrics

**Quantifiable success criteria:**

1. **Functional**: All existing fire/submission creation functionality works with new response format
2. **Performance**: API response times remain within 10% of current baseline
3. **Quality**: Zero critical bugs in core functionality after Phase 2
4. **Integration**: Client-server integration tests have 100% pass rate
5. **Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment achieved for server updates

## Success Criteria

### Fire Functionality
- ✅ Create new fires (flat structure, no hierarchy)
- ✅ List and browse fires
- ✅ Fire responses include chain key identifiers

### Submission Functionality
- ✅ Create top-level submissions in fires
- ✅ Automatic Fire parent assignment when undefined
- ✅ Submission responses include chain key identifiers
- ✅ Proper composite key usage in all operations

### Sub-comment Functionality
- ✅ Create replies to submissions (nested structure)
- ✅ Display threaded discussions correctly
- ✅ Fetch submissions with configurable nesting depth
- ✅ Proper parent-child relationships maintained

### Integration Quality
- ✅ Consistent chain key handling across all components
- ✅ No client-side composite key generation required
- ✅ Proper error handling for all edge cases
- ✅ Performance acceptable for reasonable nesting depths

## Technical Corrections & Unknowns

### Critical Error Corrections Made
1. **Server Parent Assignment Logic**: REMOVED - Chaincode handles this automatically in `contributeSubmission.ts:66-69`
2. **Database Schema Uncertainty**: RESOLVED - Chain key storage already implemented in `db.ts`
3. **DTO Import Strategy**: FIXED - Server must import chaincode DTOs directly, not define separate interfaces
4. **Three-Tier DTO Flow**: DOCUMENTED - Client → Authorization DTOs → Server → Submission DTOs → Chaincode
5. **Chain Key Generation**: CORRECTED - Server receives keys from chaincode responses, never generates them

### Unknowns Requiring Investigation
1. **Fee Authorization Implementation**: Current fires.ts has fee verification disabled (lines 120-127) - needs re-enabling
2. **Client State Migration**: What happens to existing client state when API response structure changes?
3. **Database Chain Key Storage**: Server needs to store `fireKey` and `submissionKey` from chaincode responses
4. **Error Handling Gaps**: How should server handle chaincode validation errors with new response DTOs?

### Investigation Action Items
- [ ] Test current server behavior with undefined `entryParentKey`
- [ ] Verify chaincode response objects include method calls
- [ ] Check existing client error handling for DTO validation failures
- [ ] Confirm database foreign key constraints for fire slug references

## Risk Mitigation

### Database Schema Risks
- **Risk**: Missing `chain_key` columns in database
- **Mitigation**: Create migration script before API updates
- **Validation**: Test database operations in development environment

### Client Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Existing client state becomes invalid
- **Mitigation**: Implement graceful fallbacks and cache invalidation
- **Validation**: Test with existing user sessions and data

### Composite Key Complexity
- **Risk**: Key generation inconsistencies between server and client
- **Mitigation**: Server provides all chain keys, client never generates
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all key-dependent operations

## Future Considerations

### Voting Phase (Next)
Once Fire/Submission functionality is stable, implement:
- Vote casting on nested submissions
- Vote aggregation for threaded discussions
- Vote count display in nested contexts

### Performance Optimization
- Implement submission pagination for large threads
- Add caching for frequently accessed nested structures
- Consider denormalization for deep nesting performance

### Enhanced Features
- Real-time updates for nested submissions
- Advanced threading controls (collapse/expand)
- Submission search within threads

## PM EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Issues Resolved in This Revision

1. **Dependency Order Fixed**: Original plan had client and server work in parallel despite server blocking client
2. **Critical Path Identified**: Database response parsing must happen first or everything fails
3. **Risk Management Added**: Unknown variables could derail project without pre-phase investigation
4. **Resource Planning Added**: Team structure and skills requirements clarified
5. **Decision Points Explicit**: Clear go/no-go gates prevent runaway development

### Major Plan Changes from Original

- **Added Pre-Phase Investigation**: 2 days to resolve unknowns before development
- **Resequenced Phases**: Server-first approach with explicit client dependencies
- **Added Rollback Strategy**: Each phase has clear revert procedures
- **Resource Requirements**: Specific team structure and skills needed
- **Decision Gates**: PM approval required at key milestones

### Project Confidence Assessment

- **High Confidence**: Database schema ready, chaincode interface stable
- **Medium Confidence**: Server DTO alignment, basic client integration
- **Low Confidence**: Fee verification complexity, nested submission performance
- **Unknown**: Backwards compatibility requirements, deployment constraints

### Immediate Action Items for PM

1. **Day 1**: Resolve fee verification scope decision with technical lead
2. **Day 1**: Confirm team availability and skills match requirements
3. **Day 2**: Validate all critical assumptions in Pre-Phase investigation
4. **Day 7**: First major go/no-go decision point for client work

### Success Likelihood

**With Proper Pre-Phase Investigation**: 85% confidence in successful delivery
**Without Pre-Phase Investigation**: 40% confidence due to unresolved unknowns

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Fee verification scope decision resolved early
- Database migrations validated in staging
- Server DTO parsing fixed before client work begins
- Clear API versioning strategy if backwards compatibility needed

**Critical**: Do NOT proceed to Phase 1 development until all Pre-Phase investigation tasks are complete. The unknowns identified pose significant project risk.
